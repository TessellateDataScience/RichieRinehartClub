We present our central data-driven argument and thus 'call to arms': the status-quo is completely broken and needs disrupting. 

## Get started
Python-based environment leveraging computational & visualisation modules such as Scipy & Numpy, and Matplotlib. All wrapped-up and ready-to-roll using Docker:
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
2. Download the functioning environment for current [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) notebook: `docker pull nchowlett/data-science:0.1`
3. Enable the environment: `docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" -p 8888:8888 nchowlett/data-science:0.1`
