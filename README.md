## Get started
Python-based environment leveraging computational & visualisation modules such as Scipy & Numpy, and Matplotlib. All wrapped-up and ready-to-roll using Docker:
1. [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).
2. Download the functioning environment for current notebook: `docker pull nchowlett/data-science:0.1`.
